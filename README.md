### End of day thoughts:

Managed to get the basic html structure for the home page down. Still needs a lot of fix to do.
At least I managed to get the header layout to work with flex and I think I'm finally understanding flex, kind of.

I want to get the header and footer done before continuing with the rest of the content and the other two pages since these are consistent on all three. After that I'll focus on the festival-section and review-section of the home page cause they are pretty simple and I think I could reuse a lot of the styling from there on the other sections of the other pages.

Note to self:
Finish one task/thought before switching to fixing or implementing a new idea.

### End of day thoughts:

Having problems with justifying logo to the left in header. When added as a list item it don't behave as I want to.

Kind of like the way the navbar looks now. Just needs some small changes.
Will focus on getting the footer now.

### End of day thoughts:

Managed to get a nice looking footer using flex. Have some trouble getting stuff aligned in center but I'll come back to that later.

Now all the pages have their basic structure and styling. Next step is to implement better CSS for responsiveness. I initially thought I only need flexbox for this but I might try to switch things to grid to have more control over the layout for different devices.

I'll probably just start to implement grid at the contact page for the contact form and then apply it for the rest of the webpages.

## Tuesday:

Plans for day:

Pick up on last days work and finish the contact form. I want to use grids for the contact form layout. If that goes as planned I'll want to implement grids for the rest of the websites layout since it feels like it'll be easier to control when testing for smaller screens and different media queries.

I also want to make the code cleaner. I've started to organize the style.css for better readability, although it feels that I could make both HTML and CSS cleaner with fewer classes.
