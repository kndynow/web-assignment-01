### End of day thoughts:

Managed to get the basic html structure for the home page down. Still needs a lot of fix to do.
At least I managed to get the header layout to work with flex and I think I'm finally understanding flex, kind of.

I want to get the header and footer done before continuing with the rest of the content and the other two pages since these are consistent on all three. After that I'll focus on the festival-section and review-section of the home page cause they are pretty simple and I think I could reuse a lot of the styling from there on the other sections of the other pages.

Note to self:
Finish one task/thought before switching to fixing or implementing a new idea.
